# all the functional requirements of RGB are expected to be verified by tests (one test can be used to verify more than one functional requirement)

#     capability to take as input the following L1 (i.e. CIMR and three in orbit radiometers)

#     capability to execute three different algo for remapping

#     capability to execute at least one algo for geoprojection

#     capability to generate L1c from L1

#     capability to generate L1r from L1

#     capability to generate L1c from L1r

#     capability to propagate the uncertainty

# The inputs and configuration files shall be listed and detailed: one test is expected to be fully reproducible and thus associated to

#     one set of inputs

#     one configuration file

# Pass/Fail criteria are expected to be specific and detailed to allow the verification of the functional requirements as above (see comment in Sheet1 G13 of attached file)

# we need to agree on a common definition for the test methodology

#     Please verify that the definitions that are in the sheet "Definitions" in the attached spreadsheet are fine with your approach for verification

#     add a definition of for "demonstration"
