# CIMR-RGB





## Installation 


#### Dev Environment with Nix 

To create python dev environment with nix package manager run: 
```
$ nix develop .  
```
If you are using `direnv`, just do: 
```
$ direnv allow . 
```
[__Note__]: It will take some time during the first run to build the environemnt, since nix builds python from source.
